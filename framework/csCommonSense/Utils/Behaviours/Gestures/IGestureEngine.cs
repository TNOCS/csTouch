  /// it's created when a touch is pressed, constantly feed data while the touch is moving or when it has been released.

  /// A gesture engine is expected to raise the Aborted event as soon as it fails to detect a gesture and similarily it should raise the Completed
  /// event when it has successfully recognized a gesture.
  /// 
  /// An engine will only live for one detection sequence - after either Aborted or Completed is raised, the engine will no longer be used by the handler.
