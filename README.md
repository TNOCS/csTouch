# README #

We started this repository because the original cs repository became too big. You can simply pull it and build the CommonSense dll.

### What is this repository for? ###

* CommonSense is a framework for quickly building GIS applications that feature user friendlines, support multi-site collaboration, and can easily be connected to models and simulations.
* Version 0.9

### Installation Instructions ###

Setting up the [CommonSense](https://bitbucket.org/TNOCS/commonsense) framework requires a number of steps to be taken. These are listed below.

* Make sure that Microsoft Visual Studio and the .NET framework are installed.
* Download and install Microsoft Surface 2.0 Runtime from Microsoft's website.
* Create a [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org) account.
* Obtain access to the CommonSense repository (on Bitbucket) by contacting one of the project's administrators.
* Download and install [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com).
* Create a new folder called "CommonSense" at the location where you want to place the code. The folder structure is important here. 
Inside the "CommonSense" folder, create two new folders: one called "cs" and another called "apps". The code for the CommonSense framework 
needs to be placed in the "cs" folder, whereas the code for any apps based on the framework needs to be placed in the "apps" folder. 
* Login at Bitbucket, open the CommonSense project page and click on "Clone", then choose "Clone in SourceTree".
* You can now check out the code from the repository using SourceTree. Make sure to place the code for the CommonSense framework in the "cs" folder you created earlier.
* Using SourceTree, check out the code of any apps you want to use/develop into an appropriately named subfolder within the "apps" folder.
* You should now be able to use the CommonSense framework.
